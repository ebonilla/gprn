Main Contents
-----------
1. meanfield/mf_train.m : train a GPRN model with mean-field inference method
2. meanfield/mf_predict.m : predict using a trained mean-field model obtained from mf_train.m
3. npv/npv_train.m : train a GPRN model with npv inference method
4. npv/npv_predict.m : predict using a trained npv model obtained from npv_predict.m
5. demo.m : A script demonstrating the use of mean-field and npv on a toy dataset.

Dependencies
------------------
This code uses two external libraries: the gpml package [2] and the code in [3]
with modifications by Trung V. Nguyen to handle high-dimensional datasets.
